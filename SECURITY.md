# Security Policy

## Our Programs:
All of our programs are carefully made and have been revised and scanned for **any types** of *sneaky viruses or script problems.* They are **100% trustable** and they are **completely safe.** As the programs are very *hardware intensive*, they may take some time to load. Please be patient!

## Supported Security Versions:

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 4.1.x   | :x:                |
| < 4.1   | :x:                |

## Pull requests:
To consider *changing programs and codes* in this `Software` repository you have to **pull request first and wait for approval** which should be *reviewed* in the **maximum delay of ***3 days*****! The 'Pull requests' tab is located on the top left corner of your screen (on PC).

## Reporting and suggestions: 
To *report* in general or make any *suggestions* to the repository, click the 'Issues' tab also located on the top left corner of your screen (on PC too). Then, choose a template that suits you the best or just open a blank template and then write your issue report(s) or suggestion(s) down. Once finished, just submit and your all good!

To *report* violence, unacceptable behaviour or security vulnerabilities, you can either:

1 -> Email: "gamersoftware.corp@gmail.com" and specify the username of the violator and the details of the situation. We will respond to you and confirm that we've seen your email as soon as possible.

2 -> Create a security vulnerability report in the 'Issues' tab (you know where it is now) and write your report(s) down. Once finished, just submit and we will be informed just as if you've emailed us.
